###	NAME

>__dirlib__ -- operations on the directory stack

###	SYNOPSIS

>__source dirlib__ --  ~; enables these functions

>__cleandirlist__ -- ~; removes lower redundant directories

>__depthd__ -- ~; of the directory stack

>__dirlib_doc__ -- ~;

>__dirlib_init__ -- ~;

>__dirlib_list__ -- ~ [command {echo}]; command operates on the list

>__dupd__ -- ~; => a a b c d

>__nipd__ -- ~; => a c d

>__nthdir__ -- ~ [N {2}];  => b 

>__peekd__ -- ~; "a b c d"

>__rotd__ -- ~;  a b c d => c a b d

>__swapd__ -- ~;  => b a c d

>__tuckd__ -- ~ e;  => a e b c d;

###	DESCRIPTION

>These functions add other stack operations to the shell's builtins:
 __pushd__ and __popd__.  The pictures in the [SYNOPSIS]() assume a
 directory stack of *a b c d*, with *a* on top. Only __nthdir__ and
 __tuckd__ take arugments, __nthdir__ defaults to __2__, returning
 the Nth directory on the stack and __tuckd__ _tucks_ it's argument
 under the top of the stack.

>__peekd__ give you a peek at the stack. it and the built-ins __pushd__
 and __popd__ leave their results on the standard out.
 
###	USAGE

>While I've been sorely tempted to load this into my __.profile__, I'm
 of the less-is-better mindset.  You will have to explictly source the
 library.

>>__dirlib_list fbdy__ shows the function bodies

>>__dirlib_doc__ is a convenient shorthand of the operations

>When writing functions and scripts, you may want to direct the output
 to the bit-bucket.  e.g.

>>     $ pushd some/where > /dev/null
>>      ...
>>     $ popd   > /dev/null

>Or to capture the various directories on the stack in the positional
 parameters:

>>     $ set -- $(peekd)
>>     $ echo $#            # like depthd, and 
>>     $ echo $3            # is like nthdir 3

###	ENVIRONMENT

>Most of the new operations here, namely __dupd, nipd, rotd, swapd,
 and tuckd__ derive their inspiration from similarly named (without
 the trailing _d_s) words in the Forth language.

###	BUGS

>The possibility of spaces in directory names, while guarded against,
 hasn't been sufficiently tested.  A _Cygwin_ user on a Windows
 machine may have to make special arrangements.
