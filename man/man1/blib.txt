###	    NAME

>  __blib__ -- shell library to backup any file

###	SYNOPSIS

>__source blib__
>__bkup file ...__     -- modified files are backed up
>__bkfiles__           -- lists all the currently backed-up files
>__dbkup $(bkfiles)__  -- the second time should be "quiet", it's done
>__unbkfile file__     -- remove a file from the list for routine backup.
>__bdeep N__           -- returns the name of the N-deep backup directory
>__commentType file__  -- returns the comment sentinal for the file

###	DESCRIPTION

>__bkup__ recursively descends into a local backup tree to save only
 modified copies of text and binary files.

>__bkfiles__ lists the files in the backup directory. since all files
 in a directory needn't be backed up, this saves a user from having to
 maintain a separate list.  the following utility is a to to filter the
 available backups.

>__unbkfile__ preserves the most recent backup file (by backing it up),
 and removes it and the current backup file.  this allows the bkfiles
 utility to produce just the list of needed backups.

###	VERSIONS

>when backing up a textfile which includes a leading comment with
"blib:", an identification including the user's network name, the
working directory and a time stamp are appended after the "blib:".

>the "commentType" function returns the comment sentinal for a file, 
defaulting to the scripting "#".

###	   FILES

*./.bak      -- the initial backup directory, holds the latest copy
*./.bak/.bak -- the prior backup copy, anyfile in this directory is
                 necessarily different from the current copy of a file.
*./.bak/.bak/.bak ... etc.

###	BUGS

> since the backup chain can get arbitrarily deep, a user will
  occasionally need to do some tree trimming. the author has found a
  depth of about 33 to begin breaking limbs.

>  an experimental tree pruning might be built as follows:

*  $ find $(bdeep 21) -mtime  +90 | xargs rm -fr
*  $ find $(bdeep 15) -mtime +180 | xargs rm -fr
*  $  ...
