###	NAME

>__setpathlib__  -- set the Users PATH variable

###	SYNOPSIS

     $ source setpathlib          # necessary to use the functions
     $ bitmeld                    # where is the BITMELD
     $ paths    [name defaulting to PATH]
     $ require  BITMELD    tooln  
     $ setpath  {name ending with}/bin 
     $ setpathlib_doc 
     $ set_path {a BITMELD name, e.g. include}
     $ whipath  file

###	DESCRIPTION

>  After  "source setpathlib" the functions are enabled.

>  setpath appends the directory argument to the user's PATH variable.
In an effort to enforce a bit of a standard practice, any directory
name must conclude with the name "bin" -- just plain "bin".

>  paths reports the list of the user's PATH, or other supplied
path-delimited variable name, e.g.  INCLUDE_PATH

>  whipath returns the full path to the requested "file" argument from
the user's INCLUDE_PATH variable. this is similar to "which" for files
on the user's PATH.

>  bitmeld  returns the nearest BITMELD anchor directory.

>  setpathlib_doc  produces user documentation, such as this man page.

>  set_path  constructs a BITMELD-related path variable from the 
current PATH.  

>  require adds the BITMELD/bin to the users path if the tool is not
found on the current path

###	EXAMPLES

      $ setpath $HOME/bin     appends  HOME/bin to the user's PATH if not
                              already included
    
      $ whipath stdio.h      returns   /usr/include/stdio.h 
                              on many systems
    
      $ INCLUDE_PATH=$(set_path include)   is the default
    
      $ setpath $(bitmeld)/bin  adds the local bin to the users path.
    
         e.g. if in the directory /home/group/apps/src/this
         and a directory          /home/group/apps/bin
         exists, then it's added to the PATH

###	ENVIRONMENT

>  PATH  is the list of directories to search for any command at the
shell prompt or execution by other commands or functions.

>  INCLUDE_PATH  is set to the users PATH by replacing any /bin
                with /include.  the user may set to any directory list
