 bash-functions
 --------------

these files are the "bashlib" functions.  a bashlib is a
source-able file of shell functions with a few regular 
properties:

  * name ends in ...lib
  * no comments in the library (see below)
  * only executable statement in the library is

      ...lib_init

  * a canonical reconstruction of the library is done:

     $ ( declare -f $(functions {lib}); echo {lib}_init 
       ) > new{lib}
  * the _init function does any "source"ing of other libs
  * supporting functions are named  {lib}_doc, {lib}_help,
    {lib}_manpp, etc.
  * any output from the source {lib}, which necessarily 
    invokes {lib}_init must be on stderr
